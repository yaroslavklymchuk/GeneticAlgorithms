# GeneticAlgorithms
Implementation of different Genetic and Exolution algorithms using Python

The repository was created to implement genetic algorithms.

The main **structure** of the repository:
1) genetic_algorithm.py - file with class that implements a genetic algorithm to minimize or maximize a function in given variables ranges;
2) evolution_strategy.py - file with class that implements an evolution algorithm to minimize or maximize a function in given variables ranges;
3) deformed_stars.py - file with class that implements a deformed stars algorithm to minimize a function in given variables ranges;
4) testing_functions.py - file with implementing some testing functions for an optimization task, all of the functions were given by the [link](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D1%84%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F_%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8#%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5_%D1%84%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8_%D0%B4%D0%BB%D1%8F_%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B9_%D1%86%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8_%D0%BE%D0%BF%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B8)
4) ai_ga.ipynb - jupyter notebook file that contains an experiments of using genetic algorithm to minimize particular functions and a it's comparsion with classic optimization methods;
5) ai_ga.html - html version of the jupyter notebook (open it with your browser, if you do not have a jupyter environment on your machine);
6) ai_es.ipynb - jupyter notebook file that contains an experiments of using evolution algorithm to minimize particular functions and a it's comparsion with classic optimization methods;
7) ai_es.html - html version of the jupyter notebook (open it with your browser, if you do not have a jupyter environment on your machine);
8) deformed_stars.ipynb - jupyter notebook file that contains an experiments of using deformed stars algorithm to minimize particular functions and a it's comparsion with classic optimization methods;
9) deformed_stars.html - html version of the jupyter notebook (open it with your browser, if you do not have a jupyter environment on your machine);
5) functions_plots - folder that contains a function plots and contour plots with the "stepping" of gradient descent method for functions that were considered in ai_ga.ipynb;


**Note** that in order to reproduce the code in ai_ga.ipynb and ai_es.ipynb you should use the optimization_methods.py and plot_methods.py implemented by myself and stored in my [optimization repository](https://github.com/yaroslavklymchuk/optimization)
